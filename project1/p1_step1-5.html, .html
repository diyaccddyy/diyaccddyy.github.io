     <br> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Project 1<br>
    <p> <br>&nbsp&nbsp &nbsp &nbspSeven months ago, <br>&nbsp I sat down at the small table in the kitchen <br> &nbsp of my 1960s apartment, nestled on the top floor <br>&nbsp of a building in a vibrant central neighbourhood <br>&nbsp of Tehran, and I did something I had done thousands <br>&nbsp of times previously. I opened my laptop and posted<br>&nbsp to my new blog. This, though, was the first time in <br> &nbsp six years. And it nearly broke my heart.

    <br>&nbsp&nbsp &nbsp &nbspA few weeks earlier,<br> &nbsp I’d been abruptly pardoned and freed from<br> &nbsp Evin prison in northern Tehran. I had been <br> &nbsp expecting to spend most of my life in those <br> &nbsp cells: In November 2008, I’d been sentenced <br> &nbsp to nearly 20 years in jail, mostly for things<br> &nbsp I’d written on my blog.

    <br>&nbsp&nbsp &nbsp &nbspBut the moment,<br> &nbsp when it came, was unexpected. I smoked <br>&nbsp a cigarette in the kitchen with one of my fellow <br> &nbsp inmates, and came back to the room I shared <br>  &nbsp with a dozen other men. We were sharing a cup <br> &nbsp of tea when the voice of the floor announcer<br>&nbsp — another prisoner — filled all the rooms and<br>&nbsp corridors. In his flat voice, he announced in Persian: “<br>&nbsp Dear fellow inmates, the bird of luck has once again <br> &nbsp sat on one fellow inmate’s shoulders. Mr. Hossein<br> &nbsp Derakhshan, as of this moment, you are free.” That <br> &nbsp evening was the first time that I went out of those <br> &nbsp doors as a free man. Everything felt new: The chill <br> &nbsp autumn breeze, the traffic noise from a nearby <br>&nbsp bridge, the smell, the colors of the city I had lived <br> &nbsp in for most of my life.

    <br>&nbsp&nbsp &nbsp &nbspAround me, <br> &nbsp I noticed a very different Tehran from the one <br> &nbsp I’d been used to. An influx of new, shamelessly <br> &nbsp luxurious condos had replaced the charming little houses<br> &nbsp I was familiar with. New roads, new highways, hordes <br> &nbsp of invasive SUVs. Large billboards with advertisements<br>&nbsp for Swiss-made watches and Korean flat screen TVs. <br> &nbsp Women in colorful scarves and manteaus, men with <br> &nbsp dyed hair and beards, and hundreds of charming cafes<br> &nbsp with hip western music and female staff. They were <br>&nbsp the kinds of changes that creep up on people; the<br>&nbsp kind you only really notice once normal life gets<br> &nbsp taken away from you.

    <br>&nbsp&nbsp &nbsp &nbspTwo weeks later, <br>&nbsp I began writing again. Some friends agreed to let<br> &nbsp me start a blog as part of their arts magazine.<br>&nbsp I called it Ketabkhan — it means book-reader in Persian.</p>
