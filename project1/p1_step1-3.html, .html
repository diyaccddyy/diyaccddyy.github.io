     <br><br> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Project 1<br><br>
  <p> <br>&nbsp &nbsp Seven months ago, &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspA few weeks earlier, <br>&nbsp &nbsp  I sat down at the small table in the kitchen  &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  I’d been abruptly pardoned and freed<br> &nbsp &nbsp  from of my 1960s apartment, nestled on the top floor &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp &nbspfrom Evin prison in northern Tehran.  <br>&nbsp &nbsp of a building in a vibrant central neighbourhood &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspI had been have been expecting to <br>&nbsp &nbsp of Tehran, and I did something I had done thousands &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspspend most of my life in those  <br>&nbsp &nbsp of times previously. I opened my laptop and posted &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp expecting to spend most of my life in <br>&nbsp &nbsp to my new blog. This, though, was the first time in &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  those cells: In November 2008, I’d <br> &nbsp &nbsp six years. And it nearly broke my heart. &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspbeen sentenced to nearly 20 years in &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbspjail, mostly for things I’d written on my &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspblog.</p>

    <p>&nbsp&nbsp &nbsp  But the moment, &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Around me,<br> &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp when it came, was unexpected. I smoked &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspI noticed a very different Tehran from <br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp a cigarette in the kitchen with one of my fellow  &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp the one I’d been used to. An influx of <br> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp inmates, and came back to the room I shared &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp&nbsp  new, shamelessly luxurious condos<br>  &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp with a dozen other men. We were sharing a cup &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsphad replaced the charming little <br> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp of tea when the voice of the floor announcer &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsphouses I was familiar with. New roads, <br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp — another prisoner — filled all the rooms and &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp&nbspnew highways,hordes of invasive SUVs.<br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp corridors. In his flat voice, he announced in Persian: “&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Large billboards with advertisements<br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Dear fellow inmates, the bird of luck has once again&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspfor Swiss-made watches and Korean   <br> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp sat on one fellow inmate’s shoulders. Mr. Hossein&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThat flat screen TVs.Women in colorful <br> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Derakhshan, as of this moment, you are free.”&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspscarves and manteaus, men with dyed <br> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp evening was the first time that I went out of those &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsphair and beards, and hundreds of <br> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp doors as a free man. Everything felt new: The chill  &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp charming cafes with hip western music<br> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp autumn breeze, the traffic noise from a nearby  bridge, &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspand female staff. They were the kinds of <br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspthe smell, the colors of the city I had lived
  in for most &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspchanges that creep up on people;the <br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspof my life. &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp kind you only really notice once normal <br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp life gets taken away from you.

    <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Two weeks later, <br> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp I began writing again. Some friends agreed to let<br> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp me start a blog as part of their arts magazine.<br> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp I called it Ketabkhan — it means book-reader in Persian.</p>
